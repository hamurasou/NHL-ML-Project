    "### **Why Predicting NHL Performance Is Difficult**\n",
    "Unlike the **NFL or NBA**, where most players come from a **single college system (NCAA)**, NHL players come from **dozens of different leagues** across multiple countries, each with varying levels of difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Different Leagues, Different Standards** – Scoring in the **KHL, SHL, AHL, or NCAA** is not the same.  \n",
    "✅ **Same Country, Multiple Leagues** – In North America, players can develop in the **NCAA, OHL, WHL, or USHL**, all with different competition levels.  \n",
    "✅ **International Complexity** – Players from **Europe, Russia, and North America** follow unique development paths, making performance comparisons difficult.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Makes Our Model Unique?**\n",
    "Our **Random Forest-based model** overcomes these challenges by:  \n",
    "✅ **Adjusting for League Difficulty** – Captures how hard it is to produce points in different leagues.  \n",
    "✅ **Learning from Global Data** – Incorporates stats from players across all major pre-NHL leagues.  \n",
    "✅ **Built by Players, for Players** – As hockey players, we understand the **nuances of player development** beyond just numbers.  \n",

    "### Comparing Machine Learning Models: **Random Forest vs. Multiple Linear Regression**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we experimented with **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** as a potential model for predicting **NHL performance**.  \n",
    "However, we found that **Random Forest Regression** provided **more accurate and reliable projections**, especially given the complexity of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Challenges with Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** assumes a **linear relationship** between a player's **pre-NHL stats** (goals, assists, points, games played, etc.) and their **NHL performance**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach has **several limitations**, particularly due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Variability in League Strength** – Different **pre-NHL leagues** have varying levels of **competition**, making it difficult for a simple linear model to **generalize across leagues**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Non-Linear Relationships** – The impact of stats like **goals or assists** on future performance is **not always linear** and depends on **league difficulty and competition level**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Interactions Between Variables** – A player’s development depends on **multiple interacting factors** (e.g., **playing time, team strength, league quality**), which **MLR struggles to capture** effectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Random Forest is a Better Fit**\n",
    "Random Forest Regression **outperformed MLR** because it:  \n",
    " **Captures Non-Linear Patterns** – Handles complex relationships between stats and performance.  \n",
    " **Accounts for League Differences** – Adjusts for varying league difficulties automatically.  \n",
    " **Handles Interactions Between Features** – Considers how different variables impact player development.  \n",
